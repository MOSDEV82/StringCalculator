 Preparing: Remove spaces<br>
 1.: Remove brackets... And calculate inside of bracket\n
 2.: Calculate Operations with one value (eg. pi) or one value and one operator (eg. 4² or √9)
 3.: Calculate Multiplication, Division, Modulu first!
 4.: Calculate Addition and Subtraction
 Output: √(9*2)*2²*(5*(4+10)*2-5*8+(2*4*(1+1))) = 1968.585278823348
